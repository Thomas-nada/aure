# ⛏️ Aure

**Aure** is an experimental proof-of-work blockchain built for learning, exploration, and protocol design.

It includes:

* A canonical Node.js blockchain server
* A browser-based miner
* A WebSocket protocol for block production
* Deterministic consensus rules (coinbase, PoW, difficulty)

Aure is intentionally minimal and transparent — every rule is readable in code.

---

## ✨ Features

* Proof-of-Work mining (SHA-256)
* Difficulty target–based validation
* Canonical block structure
* Coinbase rewards
* Browser miners (no install required)
* WebSocket-based mining coordination
* Persistent chain state on disk

## 🚀 Running a Server

### Requirements

* Node.js **v18+** (v20 recommended)

### Start the server

```bash
cd aure/server
npm install
node server.js
```

You should see:

```
🔥 AURE SERVER BOOT 🔥
🚀 Aure Server listening on :8080
```

---

## ⛏️ Running a Miner (Browser)

1. Serve the project root:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

3. The miner will automatically:

   * Connect to the server
   * Receive mining templates
   * Mine and submit blocks

Mining output appears in both:

* Browser console
* Server terminal

---

## 🧠 Consensus Overview

A block is accepted if and only if:

1. Height increments correctly
2. `prevHash` matches the chain tip
3. Hash matches the exact serialized block
4. Hash satisfies the target
5. Exactly one coinbase transaction exists
6. Coinbase is the first transaction
7. Block reward matches consensus rules

Invalid blocks are rejected immediately.

---

## ⚠️ Status

Aure is **experimental**.

* APIs may change
* Consensus rules are evolving
* Not intended for production use

The project prioritizes clarity and correctness over features.
