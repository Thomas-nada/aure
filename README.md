⛏ Aure Node Interface Guide

Welcome to the Aure Network. This index.html file is your portal to the decentralized Aure ledger. It allows you to mine new coins, manage your digital assets, and audit the global treasury in real-time.

🚀 Getting Started

To join the network, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Brave, or Firefox recommended).

1. Connecting to the Live Network

By default, this interface is configured to connect to the primary Aure node hosted at:
16.171.60.136

Status Indicator: Check the top-left corner of the dashboard. If it says "Live", you are successfully synchronized with the blockchain.

Manual Connection: If the connection is lost, a "Network Configuration" window will appear. Ensure the IP address matches your server's current public IP.

2. Wallet Setup (Identity)

When you first launch the interface, the system will generate a unique Aure Address and a 12-word Recovery Seed.

CRITICAL: Copy your recovery seed and store it in a safe, offline location. This seed is the only way to recover your funds if you clear your browser data.

Secure PIN: Set a 4-6 digit PIN. You will be prompted for this PIN every time you attempt to send a transaction.

💎 Features

📊 Dashboard

Network Height: View the current number of blocks in the ledger.

Treasury: Track the growth of the community treasury (funded by 1% of every block reward and 50% of all transaction fees).

Rich List: See the top holders on the network.

⛏ Mining

Continuous Mining: Click "Start Continuous Mining" to contribute your device's hashrate to securing the network.

Rewards: For every block found, the miner receives 49.50 AUR plus half of all transaction fees included in that block.

Luck & ETA: The interface provides a real-time estimate of when you might find the next block based on current network difficulty.

💼 My Wallet

Sending Funds: Enter a recipient's AUR... address and the amount. Every transaction carries a flat fee of 1.00 AUR.

Confirmations: Once sent, transactions appear in your history. As new blocks are mined, the "Confirmation" count will rise. A transaction is generally considered "final" after 6 confirmations.

Filtering: Use the history filters to view only Sent, Received, or Mining rewards.

🛡 Security Best Practices

Non-Custodial: Your private keys are stored locally in your browser's encrypted memory. The server never sees your keys.

Clearance: If you "Log Out" or clear your browser cache, your wallet will be removed from the device. Ensure your Recovery Seed is backed up before doing this.

Address Checksum: Aure addresses include a built-in checksum. If you mistype a character, the interface will prevent the transaction from being sent to avoid lost funds.

❓ Troubleshooting

"Network Error": Ensure your internet connection is active and that the AWS node at 16.171.60.136 is online.

Zero Hashrate: Some browsers may restrict background processing. Keep the tab active or ensure "Hardware Acceleration" is enabled in your browser settings.

Transaction Pending: If your transaction has 0 confirmations, it is sitting in the "Mempool." It will be processed as soon as the next block is mined.

Aure Protocol: Sovereign. Secure. Social.
